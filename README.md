## [Simply - A GUI Command Generator](project/simply)

Simply's idea spawned from the countless back-and-forth between typing out a command and reading of documentation. What if you could just click the options, and paste the generated command instead? Thus, Project Simply was created. The idea behind the project is that anybody can create command recipe schemas (in the form of a JSON file named _command_.recipe.json ([example](https://gist.github.com/jonbo/c4067cd18e5fa687e896b2358aaf9e00))) for any command-line program.

Simply makes the most sense on larger command-line programs such as [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg.html#Options) or where there are countless command arguments.
